# RAG-for-a-pdf
This project allows you to ask questions directly from a PDF document using LangChain, Ollama, and ChromaDB. It automates the process of loading a PDF, splitting it into semantic chunks, embedding them using Ollama embeddings, storing them in a Chroma vector database, and retrieving answers with LLMs like Llama 3.2.
